A phase field fracture solver implemented in Python

Solving can be done with the "Decoupled" (Molnar and Gravouil, 2017) or "Staggered" (Miehe et al., 2010) options that mimic the behavior in existing papers on the subject.  The "Coupled" option is experimental and the "Full" option is not currently functional.
